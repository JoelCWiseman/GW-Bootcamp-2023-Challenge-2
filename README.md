VBA Scripting to analyze generated stock market data

A note about this assignment. The curricurlium has not been updated to be helpful when attempting to complete this assignment. The in class course does not cover all the code needed for this assignment, and that needs to be addressed. I know that the instructor and the CSM have collected this feedback and should be submitting, but I also wanted to mention it here.

On to the assignment.

This assignment was completed with a combination programming covered in class, as well as external assistance from the following websites: 
https://www.automateexcel.com/learn-vba-tutorial/
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.calculatedfields
https://excelchamps.com/vba/
Additionally, I reviewed this assignment with a professional mentor I have from my previous employer.

Please find the attached Macro enable excel file, as well as screenshots of each worksheet in the workbook showing the VBA script having been run.
